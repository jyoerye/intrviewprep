The Amazon Kindle Store is an online e-book store where readers can choose a book from a wide range of categories. It also provides the ability to bookmark pages the user wishes to return to later. A book is represented as a binary string having two types of pages:
'0': an ordinary page
'1': a bookmarked page

Find the number of ways to select 3 pages in ascending index order such that no two adjacent selected pages are of the same type.


Count all subsequences of "101" or "010" in the array
Example
book = '01001'
        
  012,013,124,134

The following sequences of pages match the criterion:
[1, 2 ,3], that is, 01001 → 010.[1, 2 ,4], that is, 01001 → 010.[2, 3 ,5], that is, 01001 → 101.[2, 4 ,5], that is, 01001 → 101.
The answer is 4.

Function
long numberOfWays(String book)
Returns
long: the total number of ways to select 3 pages that meet the criterion


Example 2
Input
0001 → book = "0001"

Output
0
It is not possible to pick a sequence of 3 pages that satisfies the conditions.

"101"

'01001'
  1  3 count of zeros to the left of s[i]




countof010 = x * y
